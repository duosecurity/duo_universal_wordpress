Easily add Duo authentication to your WordPress website. Enable multi-factor authentication for your admins and/or users.


== Description ==
The Duo Universal plugin protects against account takeover by augmenting WordPress logins with multi-factor authentication. Adding Duo is easy and can be done in just a few minutes!

By leveraging Duo’s Universal Prompt, authentications can now use passkeys, biometrics and hardware tokens in addition to phone-based authentication methods. This keeps accounts secure if an attacker learns a user’s login credentials and provides flexible authentication options.

Duo is easy to set up and use. With Duo there’s no extra hardware or complicated software to install, just sign up for Duo’s service and install the plugin. Then you can set which user roles you want to enable multi-factor authentication for admins, editors, authors, contributors, and/or subscribers without setting up user accounts, directory synchronization, servers, or hardware. Users can enroll in Duo authentication and add MFA devices to their accounts as they log into the site.

This plugin reaches out to Duo's MFA cloud service for the configured user roles which provides an additional layer of authentication.
